# Knowledge of the Ancients - Engine

The KotA engine aims to create a landscape of language, object definitions, and story structure to allow the generation of interactive stories with unexpected and interesting choices.

This project contains the source code for the game engine.  The content is distributed elsewhere.  The engine is licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE).

The planned gameplay is initially a hunt for hidden knowledge throughout the known world.  As the engine develops, let's see where it takes us.


## Documentation

As this is an engine for others to play with, documentation is all important.  The [homepage](https://groboclown.github.io/kota) is for end-users, while the nitty-gritty notes lie in [the docs folder](docs)

Developers should get started with the [building documentation](docs/building.md).
