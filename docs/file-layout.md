# About the Project File Layout

The primary parts of the file system are:

* `/data` - storage for the base engine and example data.
    * `./modules`
        * `./0000-core` - what's necessary to get the engine up and running.
* `/docs` - developer documentation.
* `/site` - files used to generate the website for end-user consumption.
* `/src` - source code for the engine.
