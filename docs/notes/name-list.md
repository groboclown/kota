Name lists are a union of several properties?  If someone lives in Argentina with Iraqi parents, the range of possibilities for names is even bigger.  Because the name list index is a number, it means the generated name list MUST be deterministic.

Probably what needs to happen across the board is a back-reference from the attribute value to the value attribute path.

Because of that, the game must be aware of the destructive nature of adding modules to an existing game.  Doing so MUST create a copy of the existing game UNLESS the user explicitly declares that they don't want to keep the original.  Even still, the modules will be added to a new save, and that explicit declaration means that the new file will replace the old one, so that errors don't destroy the file altogether.
