Knowledge of the Ancients
=========================

You play a librarian in an alternate Earth, cira 1804.  You are charged with
curating a collection of rare and obscure literature regarding the ancient
religions and their practices (ala Cthulhu inspiration; "The Fell Coal Age").

You have at your disposal *explorers* whom you direct to investigate the
remote locations of the globe to uncover these works, or to write down the
oral traditions of the isolated peoples still practising said beliefs.

The game is mostly text based (maybe some pretty pictures).  The two main
tools available to the librarian are correspondence through letters with the
explorers, and examination of clues reported by the correspondence.

Through this, the explorers must endure physical and mental trauma.  Different
cults require different attributes (psychosis, self-mutilation, language, etc.)
in order to be allowed to understand the deeper mysteries.  Explorers will die,
new ones will arrive.  Each has a different story.

The librarian will start with a small library.  These books contain very general
*clues* to start the game.  Some may be poorly translated (or abridged or
altered) versions of more official texts.  Clues can then be used to guide
explorers into new locations, or to revisit old ones with new guiding knowledge.
Clues can also be combined with other ones to discover deeper *insights*, which
in turn may reveal the secret knowledge of the ancients.


Tone
----

Very, very dark.  The "good" and "bad" cults all require torment on the part of
the explorer.


Mechanics
---------


### Clues

Clues are doodles on paper drawn by a mad artist, a hushed whisper from a
village elder, or a cry from a child's nightmare, duly collected by the
explorers and reported to the librarian.  The librarian must catalogue the clues
to discover *insights*.

(TODO is this reasonable?)

Combining clues should be a big mechanic.  Perhaps arranging them together in
a combination 3x3 square or in line like a sentence, or perhaps a variety of
layouts.  Some clues will be naturally related.

Clues can be misleading, wrong, troubling, hopeful, and so on.  They can be
associated with mysteries, regions, peoples, or various stories that stretch
across regions.  Even wrong clues can be helpful in the right circumstances.

Combined clues will create:
    * Nothing.
    * A clue (with the various attributes listed)
    * An insight.
    * Madness - a secret so troubling you destroy the clues.

Knowledge is accumulative.  The librarian may use clues without destroying them,
unless a bad roll is made and the clues are intentionally destroyed.


### Insights

Details a new line of inquiry, or a new location, or the key for
translating a forgotten language.  These are the paths in which the librarian
may direct explorers to search for hidden clues.

Insights are like people.  They have associations that may or may not agree
with the librarian.  If the librarian dislikes an attribute so drastically,
they will not instruct explorers about the insight.  Future changes in
librarian attributes may permit it, or an explorer may stumble across it
anyway.

One way to score the game.  With enough insight, the librarian might publish
a new book.  This will bring fame, and allow for more explorers to be operating
at once.


### The Ancients

The Ancients are god-like beings, either real or imagined, with a core set of
ideals and taboos.  Different mysteries may be vastly different interpretations
of the same Ancient.

Insights point toward the stories and ideas about The Ancients.  Such stories
and ideas are limitless, though, as no human may truly understand them.


### Mysteries

Here meaning a the secrets of a mystery cult.  These are major areas of
investigation, each with their own symbolism and meanings.

A mystery reflects one or more Ancient and some stories about them.  These
may overlap with other mysteries, or even downright contradict them.


### Locations

A location is a place which possibly houses a mystery for an explorer to
investigate.  It usually is home to a people (possibly extinct), maybe more
than one.

A location has its own attributes.  A bustling city.  A dank, stagnant swamp.
A dry, lifeless desert.  A small community with suspicious stones.  Each
one has one or more stories of the Ancients associated with it.


### Peoples

A group of people with a shared history, language, ideals, taboos, mysteries,
and so on.

Explorers interact with peoples, in the hopes for discovering clues.  The
better the ideals and taboos of the people match with the attributes the
explorer exhibits, the more or better clues the explorer may discover.
The worse these ideals and taboos match, the higher the risk to the
explorer.  In some cases, the peoples may offer (or force) a "rite of passage"
that permanently adjusts the explorer's attributes.

Peoples may refer to an extinct people.  Knowledge is obtained through
archaeology.


### Travel

Explorers must travel to locations.  These are bound to be mishaps or troubles,
all of which may impede the explorer.  The explorer might get lost and find
an unexpected new location or people.


### Explorers

People whom the librarian instructs to investigate various insights.

Explorers have different backgrounds, which affect their attributes and
aptitudes.

Some examples:
    * A young soldier, wounded in war, now looking for another way to find a
        thrill of travel and danger.
    * A monk who visits remote libraries, studies languages, and meditates
        on subjects.
    * A rich poet seeking fame and stories.
    * An archaeologist searching for new discoveries.
    * A poor but good-willed doctor, wanting travel to aid those with the
        greatest need.
    
Explorers should have their own voices.  Familiarity with certain words.
Hopeful, fearful, timid, stupid.

The librarian should be mindful of the ideals and taboos of the explorer, and
how well that matches expected locations.


### Letters of Correspondence

Explorers communicate with the Librarian via *letters of correspondence*
(sometimes called *reports*).
This is the way the librarian finds out about what is going on.

The librarian can write instructions to the explorer in the form of
several options.  The letters take time to travel - they use the Post Office
Packet Service, which used packet ships to carry mail throughout the kingdom.


### Traits

Each type of place has its own set of traits.  If one of that type has a
trait, then they all have that trait.  Traits should be on a scale from 0 to 1,
with .5 being the "norm" (maybe?).

Some example traits:
    * Humans:
        * Cowardice
        * Agresiveness
        * Stupidity
        * Loquatiousness
    * Locations:
