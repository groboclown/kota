# Building and Deploying Different Parts

## Initial Setup

Download the repository, and run:

```(bash)
npm install
```

## Testing

This is extra handy while developing code:

```(bash)
npm run test:watch
```

## Website

The site is generated through Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

To locally try it out (taken from [here](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/))

Install the necessary Ruby gems:

```(bash)
bundle install
```

Serve up the files:

```(bash)
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Please be aware of the limitations to the GitHub Jekyll plugins.
