*Or, Why Everyone Should Care*

The earliest ideas for this game came from a vision of representing the memory model for a game, where all the things in the game could influence each other to create "interesting behavior", whatever that meant.

It eventually took shape as a wildly connected world that takes its form from a Fuzzy Cognitive Map.

[After](https://sourceforge.net/p/groboutils/groborpg/ci/default/tree/phase1/) [several](https://sourceforge.net/p/groboutils/groborpg/ci/default/tree/phase1.1/) [attempts](https://bitbucket.org/groboclown/survival-webgame/overview), I tried a version in Dart, which ended up creating a ["Discrete Reactive Simulation Library for Dart"](https://github.com/groboclown/drs-lib.dart/wiki).  That was an interesting project that lead me down some fun computer science papers.  However, building the underlying state for the system required a dense web that would be difficult to set up well, especially in such a way that it could create stories for interaction with people.

That's when I realized that the project just wasn't workable on the kind of time I could spend on it.

The basic concept of this project started with looking at the [problem with modeling a group of people](https://github.com/groboclown/drs-lib.dart/blob/master/doc/Model-Problems.md).  How do you "peel" off people from the group if the engine needs some specific information?  What if the kinds of things it creates are really different?  How can we get a story to work correctly with all of that?

I started looking at the problem as creating text, because words are easier to manipulate that images.  And here we are.

There's a lot of twists and turns along the way that bore me, so I'm not writing them.
