# About

The compiler that converts human maintained files into a compact format processed by the KotA engine.

Unlike the strict rules behind the low-level engine formats, the compiler formats have much looser forms, and include short-hand expressions to make common declarations a snap.

Additionally, by putting this into an external format, it allows for an evolution of the forms of module representation independent of the engine.
