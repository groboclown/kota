# Describes how to localize the translated text.

localization:
  parent: null
  locale: en_US
  name: US English

  # If this locale isn't available, try these next.
  alternates: [ en_EN, en ]

  number:
    decimal: .
    grouping: ","

    # Ordered count of digits to print before a separator.  The last
    # item indicates that it is repeated.  So "[3, 2]" means to show
    # 123456789 as "12,34,56,789", and "[3]" means show it as
    # "123,456,789"
    grouping-count: [ 3 ]

    # Standard number conversion strings.
    negative: "-"
    positive: "+"

    # Digits to use for whatever radix is requested (binary, hexadecimal, etc)
    # for lower case.  This implicitly embeds the zero digit.  These must be
    # 1 UTF-8 character per digit.  Note that this is a case where localization
    # in one region with fewer digits will not render correctly.  For that
    # reason, all locales MUST support EXACTLY 16 digits.
    digitsUpper: "0123456789ABCDEF"
    digitsLower: "0123456789abcdef"

  date-markers:
    # Date formatting is isolated to the specific markers.  This allows
    # flexibility in generating date text in many different ways.
    # The kinds of expressions are very locale specific, and should be used
    # with the locale-specific translations.

      # Marker indicates the date shorthand.  It can override existing ones
      # to change up the translation.  Be careful with this!
      marker: 'D'

      # Source of the date value.  This is one of:
      #   day - numeric day of the month (1-31), with no leading zero.
      #   month - numeric month of the year (1-12), with no leading zero.
      #   year - numeric 4-digit year.
      #   yr - last 2 digits of the year.
      #   week - numeric day of the week (0-6), with 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, ...
