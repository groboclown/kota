# List of all the processing files in the module.
# Lines starting with '#' are ignored, as are blank spaces.
# See `docs/modules/file-formats.md` for details.
# Media files and translation files should not be included in this list.

# This list can include `manifest.list` and `module.yaml`, but they are
# always loaded, so they don't need to be here.  They are essentially ignored.
