## About the Project

The KotA engine aims to create a landscape of language, object definitions, and story structure to allow the generation of interactive stories with unexpected and interesting choices.

This project contains the source code for the game engine.  The content is distributed elsewhere.  The engine is licensed under the MIT license.

The planned gameplay is initially a hunt for hidden knowledge throughout the known world.

## The Clockwork World

KotA is split into these groups of data:

* kinds of things can can be created (*nouns*)
* kinds of things required to allow stuff to happen (*verbs*)
* Chains of things that happen (*stories*)

KotA itself then creates chains of verbs that create a story

There's a lot more to what the engine can handle, but that's mostly details under these basic definitions.
